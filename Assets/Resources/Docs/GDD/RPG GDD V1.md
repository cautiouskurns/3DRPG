# Generic RPG Foundation - Episode 1

## Game Design Document

---

## **Project Philosophy**

### **Foundation-First Approach**

This project follows a **“generic skeleton first, unique mechanics later”** philosophy. We deliberately build a completely standard, working JRPG using proven conventions, then layer innovative mechanics on top of the solid foundation.

### **Always-Playable Development**

Every milestone produces a complete, demonstrable game experience. No prototype exists that can’t be shown to someone else and immediately understood.

### **Strategic Genericism**

We intentionally use the most standard RPG conventions possible during foundation development to minimize technical risk, leverage existing knowledge, and create a stable platform for testing unique mechanics later.

# **3. Systems Design**

## **Character System**

The character system follows classic JRPG conventions with seven core stats that cover all combat and progression needs. This intentionally simple approach allows players to understand their character’s capabilities at a glance while providing clear upgrade paths. The linear progression ensures steady power growth without overwhelming decision-making during the foundation phase.

### **Core Stats**

| Stat | Range (Lvl 1-10) | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health Points (HP) | 50-500 | Survivability in combat |
| Magic Points (MP) | 20-200 | Resource for spell casting |
| Attack | 10-50 | Physical damage modifier |
| Defense | 5-25 | Physical damage reduction |
| Magic Attack | 8-40 | Magical damage modifier |
| Magic Defense | 5-20 | Magical damage reduction |
| Speed | 15-35 | Turn order in combat |

The level progression is designed to provide meaningful advancement every level while maintaining balance throughout Episode 1. Spells are learned automatically at predetermined levels to eliminate choice paralysis during the generic foundation phase. XP requirements scale to maintain consistent pacing, with story milestones providing substantial rewards to encourage narrative engagement.

### **Level Progression**

| Level | XP Required | HP Gain | MP Gain | Spell Learned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 50 base | 20 base | - |
| 2 | 100 | +30 | +12 | Fireball |
| 3 | 250 | +30 | +12 | - |
| 4 | 450 | +35 | +15 | Cure |
| 5 | 700 | +35 | +15 | - |
| 6 | 1000 | +40 | +18 | Shield |
| 7 | 1350 | +40 | +18 | - |
| 8 | 1750 | +45 | +20 | Lightning Bolt |
| 9 | 2200 | +45 | +20 | - |
| 10 | 2700 | +50 | +25 | Greater Cure |

**XP Sources:** Regular enemies (25-50 XP), Strong enemies (75-100 XP), Story milestones (200-500 XP)

## **Combat System**

The combat system prioritizes strategic decision-making over reflexes, using proven turn-based mechanics that allow players to consider their options carefully. Speed determines initiative order, creating tactical decisions around character builds and equipment choices. The five core actions provide comprehensive options without overwhelming complexity.

### **Combat Actions**

| Action | Effect | Success Rate | Special Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attack | (Attack - Enemy Defense) + 1-5 damage | 95% | 5% critical hit chance (2x damage) |
| Magic | Spell-specific damage/effect | 90% | Costs MP, elemental interactions |
| Defend | 50% damage reduction, +5 MP | 100% | Lasts until next turn |
| Items | Immediate effect | 100% | Doesn’t end turn |
| Run | Escape combat | 75% | Unavailable in boss fights |

The elemental system creates rock-paper-scissors relationships that encourage tactical thinking and spell variety. Status effects provide additional strategic depth while remaining simple enough to understand quickly. Each element has clear strengths, weaknesses, and unique status effects that create memorable combat moments.

### **Elemental System**

| Element | Weak To | Strong Vs | Status Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fire | Ice | Earth | Burn (3-5 damage/turn, 3 turns) |
| Ice | Fire | Lightning | Freeze (skip next turn) |
| Lightning | Earth | Ice | Shock (50% turn loss, 2 rounds) |
| Earth | Lightning | Fire | Slow (50% speed, 4 turns) |

## **Magic System**

Magic serves as both tactical combat tool and resource management challenge. The MP system creates meaningful decisions about when to use powerful spells versus conserving resources. Spell categories provide clear roles - offensive magic for damage, healing for survivability, and utility for tactical advantages. The limited spell list ensures each spell feels important and useful.

### **Spell List**

| Spell | Type | Damage/Effect | MP Cost | Level Learned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fireball | Fire Attack | 15-25 damage | 8 | 2 |
| Ice Shard | Ice Attack | 12-20 damage | 8 | 4 |
| Lightning Bolt | Lightning Attack | 18-28 damage | 10 | 8 |
| Stone Spear | Earth Attack | 20-30 damage | 12 | 10 |
| Cure | Healing | Restore 30-50 HP | 12 | 4 |
| Greater Cure | Healing | Restore 60-100 HP | 25 | 10 |
| Shield | Utility | +50% Defense, 5 turns | 10 | 6 |
| Haste | Utility | +50% Speed, 5 turns | 15 | 8 |

MP regenerates slowly outside combat (1 MP per 10 seconds) to encourage exploration pacing and makes MP restoration items valuable. Full MP restoration on level up provides relief from resource pressure and creates positive feedback for character advancement.

## **Inventory System**

The inventory system emphasizes simplicity and strategic decision-making over micromanagement. Limited consumable slots create meaningful choices about which items to carry, while auto-replacing equipment eliminates tedious inventory sorting. Key items have unlimited storage to prevent story progression blocks.

### **Item Categories**

| Category | Slot Limit | Replacement | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Consumables | 20 slots | Manual use | Health Potion (40 HP), Magic Potion (25 MP) |
| Equipment | Auto-replace | Automatic | Weapons, Armor, Accessories |
| Key Items | Unlimited | Cannot drop | Story items, dungeon keys |

Equipment progression follows clear upgrade paths with meaningful stat improvements and occasional special properties. Each equipment tier represents a significant power increase that players can feel immediately. The progression is designed to align with story beats and exploration rewards.

### **Equipment Progression**

| Equipment | Attack | Defense | Speed | Special | Acquisition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starting Sword | +5 | - | - | - | Initial equipment |
| Iron Sword | +12 | - | - | - | Found in dungeon |
| Magic Sword | +18 | - | - | +5 Magic Attack | Boss reward |
| Cloth Robe | - | +3 | - | - | Starting equipment |
| Leather Armor | - | +8 | - | - | Shop purchase |
| Chain Mail | - | +15 | -2 | - | Treasure chest |

## **Save & Progression System**

The save system prioritizes reliability and simplicity over complex features. Auto-save triggers at critical moments ensure players never lose significant progress, while the single save file eliminates confusion about save management. JSON format allows for easy debugging and potential future modding support.

### **Save Data Components**

| Data Type | Includes | Auto-Save Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Character Progress | Level, XP, stats, spells | Level up |
| Inventory State | Equipment, items, quantities | Area transition |
| World State | Location, story flags, NPCs | Story milestones |
| Settings | Volume, controls, preferences | Manual only |

Manual save points in towns and safe areas provide player agency while auto-save handles critical moments. The system tracks comprehensive game state to ensure seamless session continuation and proper story flag management.

## **Dialogue & NPC System**

The dialogue system serves as the primary vehicle for story delivery, world-building, and player guidance. By focusing on linear conversations during the foundation phase, we eliminate the complexity of branching dialogue trees while still delivering rich narrative content. The system prioritizes clarity and accessibility, ensuring players can engage with the story at their own pace without confusion or frustration.

### **NPC Types & Functions**

| NPC Type | Purpose | Interaction Style | Conversation Length | Repeatable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Story NPCs | Advance main plot | Required conversations | 5-15 lines | One-time or state-based |
| Lore NPCs | World background | Optional deep-dive | 3-20 lines | Fully repeatable |
| Merchants | Buy/sell items | Transaction interface | 2-5 lines + shop UI | Always available |
| Tutorial NPCs | Explain mechanics | Guided instruction | 3-10 lines | Repeatable until mastered |

Each NPC type serves distinct gameplay functions while maintaining narrative coherence. Story NPCs gate plot progression and provide essential objectives, while Lore NPCs reward curious players with optional world-building content. Merchants combine functional utility with personality, and Tutorial NPCs ensure mechanical understanding without breaking immersion.

| Line Content | Text string array | Actual dialogue | Sequential text blocks |
| Trigger Conditions | Boolean flags | Conversation availability | Story progression requirements |
| Completion Effects | System actions | Post-dialogue changes | Flag updates, item rewards |

The dialogue system uses simple data structures optimized for clarity and ease of modification. Conversations are stored as arrays of text lines with associated metadata, making content creation and editing straightforward. Trigger conditions and completion effects integrate seamlessly with the save system and story progression.

Dialogue features prioritize accessibility and player control above complex branching systems. Text speed options accommodate different reading preferences, while text history and skip options respect player time. Character portraits and clear name display ensure conversation tracking remains effortless, while high contrast and large text options support visual accessibility needs.
